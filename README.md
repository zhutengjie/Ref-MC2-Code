**The complete code is coming soon.**

The code provides:

- [x] Training code for learning PBR materials and environment light
- [ ] Training code for learning the geometry

# News

- **[9/26/2024]** Ref-MC2 has been accepted by NeurIPS 2024.

# Install

Tested in Anaconda3 with Python 3.9 and cuda 11.3, 11.6, 11.8 on the following GPUs: RTX3090, A5000 and A6000

Note that your *torch* version must correspond to your *cuda* version. *cudnn* does not need to be installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/zhutengjie/Ref-MC2-Code.git
conda create -n refmc2 python=3.9
conda activate refmc2

# Data


In our material learning code, we provide our two sample geometries under the geo folder. One is **materials** in [NeRF synthetic dataset](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=18JxhpWD-4ZmuFKLzKlAw-w5PpzZxXOcG), and the other is **coral** in the [NeRO](https://github.com/liuyuan-pal/NeRO?tab=readme-ov-file) dataset. We have converted the format of the NeRO real dataset into (.**json**) format, the code for converting format will also be provided later.


Please download the data set and organize it as followsï¼š
```
learning_materials
|-- data
    |-- nero
        |-- coral 
            ...
    |-- nerf_synthetic
        |-- materials
            ...
```

# Train

```
python train.py --config configs/nerf_materials.json
```

The results will be saved in the out folder.
If you want to run offline on a specific GPU:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 nohup python -u train.py --config configs/nerf_materials.json > output.log 2>&1 &
```
